Why Design Patterns?
The advantages of design patterns are:

To provide standard terminology that everybody understands
Not to repeat the same mistakes over and over again
What Are the Types of Design Patterns?
The design patterns we talk about here, are from the perspective of an object-oriented world. There are mainly three different kinds of design patterns:

Creational Patterns
Structural Patterns
Behavioral Patterns

***************
Creational
***************
Creational patterns deal with the creation of objects.

***************
Structural
***************
Structural patterns deal with the composition of objects.

It deals with questions such as:

What does a class contain?
What are the relationships of a class with other classes? Is it inheritance or composition?

******************
Behavioral
******************

Behavioral patterns focus more on the behavior of objects, or more precisely, interactions between objects.
